Hello World!
<h1>Emily Schmitt</h1>
<h2>Class of 2023</h2>
<h3>English & Digital Studies Double Major</h3>
<body>
  <p>Well, first of all this class fit perfectly into my schedule. I thought I should get that reason out of the way. Second, I'm super interested in design and specifically digital design. I've worked in Wordpress before, but the idea of actually codiing websites and getting to create content by learning HTML is super intersting to me </p>
<p>I've worked on Wordpress before and I learned how to code in Wolfram last semester. Those are really the only digital productions I've done. I've created several Wordpress sites for resume and job purposes and in some of my classes. I also was in Dr. Sample's Game Design seminar last semester and we produced a somewhat viable game on Twine. I mostly helped with visuals on that project, as well as the storyline.</p>
<p>By the end of this course I would like to:
  <ul>
    <li>Be profiecient in HTMl, CSS, and JS.</li>
    <li>Have created a website that I could present to others</li>
    <li>Tap into the creative side of the digital world and create something less traditional and more experiemental.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>

  <a href="https://www.queeringthemap.com/">Queering the Map</a>
</h3>
<p>This is a digital project I was introduced to by Dr. Mark Sample in my Intro to Digital Studies class. Ever since then, it's my go-to digital project example. What's so interesting about this project is the collaboration aspect as well as the contirbutor's anonymity. You can zoom on almost any part of the country and get quick snippets contributed by queer people, telling their short story they might not be able to tell to anyone else. Not only do I think this allows people to be seen, but I think it lets people know they are not alone.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the best things about this project, is the Davidson contribution. There is one point that is clearly in Belk dorm and I wouldn't be surprised if we get a lot more in the coming years, as long as people know about the project</li>
  </ul>
<h3>
<a href="http://www.lilielbe.org/">Lili Elbe Digital Archive</a>
</h3>
<p>This is a project I studied over this past summmer in an online class. Not only did I not know who Lili Elbe was before studyign this project, but I'd never seen a text comparison like the one this project assembles. The <a  href="http://www.lilielbe.org/narrative/collationStudio.html">Collation Studio</a> allows users to compare differetn version of Elbe's text, right next to one another.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not only can you comapre these documents, but this website makes available and accessible editions of ELbe's books that might otherwise be kept hidden int he shelves of a library. This website represents what a lot of digital archivistis aim to do: make accessible resources to anyone with an internet connectiona dn computer</li>
  </ul>

 <h3>
   <a href="https://j-archive.com/">Jeopardy! Archive<a>
     </h3>
     <p>The final project I want to highlight is less about diigtal archives or activism, but instead deals with Jeopardy! I ran trivia for Davidson last year and I used this resource all the time for trivia categories and other ideas. This account records almost all of the Jepoardy games and their questions back to Season 1, which premiered in 1985.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>You can choose the season and then a specific game to see who hosted that day, the circumstances of the game, and the scores of each contestant (plus their names) at the end of each round.</li>
       <li>The site is also always being updated to include current games. The most recent game to be included is from <a href="https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=7123">August 13, 2021!<a></li>
       <li>I love the fact that this site is assembled by Jeopardy! fans and you can sometimes seen the "homegrown" aspects of the site. For example, most of the daily doubles or picture-based questions are missing. Yet, the site's design and color scheme are so on-point, it's easy to forgive these smalls absences.</li>

       </ul>
