  <p>Well, first of all this class fit perfectly into my schedule. I thought I should get that reason out of the way. Second, I'm super interested in design and specifically digital design. I've worked in Wordpress before, but the idea of actually codiing websites and getting to create content by learning HTML is super intersting to me </p>
<p>I've worked on Wordpress before and I learned how to code in Wolfram last semester. Those are really the only digital productions I've done. I've created several Wordpress sites for resume and job purposes and in some of my classes. I also was in Dr. Sample's Game Design seminar last semester and we produced a somewhat viable game on Twine. I mostly helped with visuals on that project, as well as the storyline.</p>
<p>By the end of this course I would like to:
  <ul>
    <li>Be profiecient in HTMl, CSS, and JS.</li>
    <li>Have created a website that I could present to others</li>
    <li>Tap into the creative side of the digital world and create something less traditional and more experiemental</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
