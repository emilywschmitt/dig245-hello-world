<h1>Emily Schmitt</h1>
<h2>Class of 2023</h2>
<h3>English & Digital Studies Double Major</h3>
<body>
  <strong>Why am I taking this course?</strong>
  <br>Well, first of all this class <em>fit perfectly into my schedule.</em> I thought I should get that reason out of the way. Second, I'm super interested in design and specifically digital design. I've worked in Wordpress before, but the idea of actually coding websites and getting to create content by learning HTML is super compelling.
<p>
  <strong>Any experience creating content for the web or in programming?</strong><br>
  I've worked on Wordpress before and I learned how to code in Wolfram last semester. I've created several Wordpress sites for resume purposes, as well as for projects in some of my classes. I was also in Dr. Sample's Game Design seminar last semester and we produced a somewhat viable game on Twine. I mostly helped with visuals on that project, as well as the storyline.</p>
<strong>By the end of this course I would like to:</strong>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be profiecient in HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
    <li>Have created a website that I could present to others.</li>
    <li>Tap into the creative side of the digital world and create something less traditional and more experiemental.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
  <strong>Learn Computing Activity</strong>
  <br>I chose to follow the Command Line activity, because I didn't get in as much practice in class as I would have hoped. I've worked in terminal before, but understanding how it actually works has always eluded me. The command line receives instructions via text from the user and tells the operating system to run them once the user presses enter. You can navigate files, create new directories, and explore your computer in this text-based application.

<p>This is a digital project I was introduced to by Dr. Sample in my Intro to Digital Studies class. Ever since then, it's my go-to digital project. What's so interesting about this project is the collaboration aspect as well as the contirbutors' ability to comment anonymously. You can zoom in on almost any part of the world and read short stories or anecdotes written by people from the LGBTQIA+ community. Not only do I think this allows people to be seen, but I think it lets people know they are not alone.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the best things about this project is the Davidson contribution. There is one point that is clearly in Belk dorm.</li>
  <li>I also love this project because of that idea that people writing these stories might not have anyone else they feel comfortable sharing their stories with, but they trust Queering the Map.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>
<a href="http://www.lilielbe.org/">Lili Elbe Digital Archive</a>
</h3>

<p>This is a project I studied over this past summmer in an online class. Not only did I not know who Lili Elbe was (one of the first people to go through a sex-change surgery) before studying this project, but I'd never seen a text comparison like the one this project assembles. The <a  href="http://www.lilielbe.org/narrative/collationStudio.html">Collation Studio</a> allows users to compare different versions of Elbe's text (describing her transition), right next to one another.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not only can you compare these documents, but this website makes editions of Elbe's books digitally available that might otherwise be kept hidden in the shelves of a library. This website represents what a lot of digital archivistis aim to do: make resources accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a computer</li>
  </ul>

   <a href="https://j-archive.com/">Jeopardy! Archive<a>

<p>The final project I want to highlight is less about digital archives or activism, but instead deals with Jeopardy! I ran trivia for Davidson last year and I used this resource all the time for trivia categories and other ideas. This website is a record of almost all of the Jepoardy games and their questions going all the way back to Season 1, which premiered in 1985.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>You can choose the season and then a specific game to see who hosted that day, the circumstances of the game, and the scores of each contestant (plus their names) at the end of each round.</li>
       <li>The site is also always being updated to include current games. The most recent game to be included is from <a href="https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=7123">August 13, 2021!<a></li>
       <li>I love the fact that this site is assembled by Jeopardy! fans and you can sometimes seen the "homegrown" aspects of the site.</li>

       </ul>

       <!--I hadn't finished Codeacademy 1-2 which goes over linking text before completing this, so I was a little thrown off there. Other than that, everything was pretty easy. I don't have HTML commands off the top of my head or anything, but I can get there when I need to. I also experimented with images and the hardest part with that was getting their width and height correct - I got there, but still. I'm also unsure if my alt text is correct. Right now, my biggest challenge has been making sure my GitHub is connected Atom... I still don't think I'm all the way there yet-->
